# Doxygen MCP Server
A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides full access to Doxygen's documentation generation capabilities. This server enables AI assistants like Claude to generate, configure, and manage documentation for any supported programming language through a clean, powerful interface.

Refer to the `docs/` directory in this repository for more comprehensive documentation.

## Overview
The Doxygen MCP Server automates the generation of documentation from source code comments, parsing information about classes, functions, and variables to produce output in formats like HTML and PDF. By simplifying and standardizing the documentation process, it enhances collaboration and maintenance across diverse programming languages and project scales.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Doxygen** (required) - [Installation guide](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)
- **uv** package manager - [Installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Graphviz** (optional, for diagrams) - [Installation guide](https://graphviz.org/download/)
- **LaTeX** (optional, for PDF) - [Installation guide](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
- **Claude Desktop** or **Claude for Windows**

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Doxygen

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install doxygen

# macOS
brew install doxygen

# Windows
# Download from https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd doxygen-mcp

# Install with uv
uv sync
```

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add Doxygen MCP to `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "doxygen-mcp": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/absolute/path/to/doxygen-mcp",
        "run",
        "doxygen-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows Example**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "doxygen-mcp": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\.local\\bin\\uv.exe",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "D:\\dev\\doxygen-mcp",
        "run",
        "doxygen-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

Close and reopen Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server.

### 5. Verify Installation

In Claude, try:
```
What MCP tools do you have available?
```

You should see Doxygen MCP tools listed.

### 6. Basic Usage Example

```
Create a Doxygen project for my C++ codebase at /path/to/project
```

Claude will initialize a Doxygen project with appropriate configuration.
